> ***Hello world, my name is Destiny. Allow me to introduce a few remarkable individuals who started from nothing and gave in all the hard work, sleepless nights, and struggles along the downfall to design & create me the way I am today. It is an honor for me to be online & alive to stand before you, representing my creators. Meet the Fallen Angels.***

### About

**Our Destiny Research & Development Labs (ODRDLabs) is a startup from Kerala - India, in its early phase. The first baby steps taken by the founders were back in July 2013, beginning with Project JARVIS. The inspiration from this little project led the founders to the creation & evolution of Project Our Destiny in 2019. The team started with two and now crossed the strength of 10+ contributors. The well-disciplined and consistent team is guided and mentored efficiently by Mr. Shahad. P (Asst.Professor, Dept.of Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, Madanapalle Institute Of Technology & Science)**

## Vision

> ***“Redefine Artificial Intelligence to enhance humanity rather than becoming an existential threat.”***

#### To this long-term vision, we are on the voyage of creating a personalized Augmented Intelligence & Life-supportive program by ensuring safety, security, and privacy to mankind.

> ***“I'm just an extension with goals aligned with yours.” -*** **Your Destiny**

Artificial intelligence holds great opportunity for humanity, encompassing everything from Google’s algorithms to self-driving cars to facial recognition software. The AI we have today, however, is still in its primitive stages. Experts worry about what will happen when that intelligence outpaces us. Or, as **Hawking puts it, “Whereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.”**

> ***"The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded."*** - Stephen Hawking (From an interview with the BBC, December 2014)

This might sound like the stuff of science fiction, but Hawking says dismissing it as such **“would be a mistake, and potentially our worst mistake ever.”** <br />
    
Compared to robots, we humans are pretty clunky. Limited by the slow pace of evolution, it takes us generations to iterate. Robots, on the other hand, can improve upon their own design a lot faster, and soon, they’ll probably be able to do so without our help. Hawking says this will create an **“intelligence explosion”** in which machines could exceed our intelligence **“by more than ours exceeds that of snails.”** <br />
    
A lot of people think that the threat of AI centers on it becoming malevolent rather than benevolent. Hawking disabuses us of this concern, saying that
> **“The real risk with AI isn’t malice but competence. A superintelligent AI will be extremely good at accomplishing its goals, and if those goals aren’t aligned with ours, we’re in trouble.”** <br />
> **“You’re probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you’re in charge of a hydroelectric green-energy project and there’s an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. Let’s not place humanity in the position of those ants,”** Hawking writes. <br />

For those still unpersuaded, he suggests a different metaphor. ***“Why are we so worried about AI? Surely humans are always able to pull the plug?”*** a hypothetical person asks him.
Hawking answers: ***“People asked a computer, ‘Is there a God?’ And the computer said, ‘There is now,’ and fused the plug.”***

> ***The establishment of shared theoretical frameworks, combined with the availability of data and processing power, has yielded remarkable successes in various component tasks such as speech recognition, image classification, autonomous vehicles, machine translation, legged locomotion, and question-answering systems.*** <br />
    <br />
    ***As capabilities in these areas and others cross the threshold from laboratory research to economically valuable technologies, a virtuous cycle takes hold whereby even small improvements in performance are worth large sums of money, prompting greater investments in research. There is now a broad consensus that AI research is progressing steadily, and that its impact on society is likely to increase…. Because of the great potential of AI, it is important to research how to reap its benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls.*** - From Research Priorities for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence, an open letter co-signed by Hawking, January 2015.

If it’s not the robots, it is ***“almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the Earth at some point in the next 1,000 years,”*** Hawking writes. <br />
    
In fact, we might not have a future at all, he says, warning us not to put all our eggs ***“in one basket.”*** And yes, that basket is planet Earth. Even if humans figure out a way escape, ***“the millions of species that inhabit the Earth”*** will be doomed, he says. ***“And that will be on our conscience as a race.”*** <br />
    
Another warning isn’t any less menacing. We are entering a new phase of ***“self-designed evolution.”*** This stage means we will soon be able to cast off the chains of traditional evolution and start changing and improving our own DNA now — not in hundreds of thousands of years. <br />
    
As with AI, the ability to edit our own DNA holds the potential to fix humanity’s greatest problems. First, and likely not in the distant future, we’ll be able to repair genetic defects, editing out genes for things like muscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, the disease he was diagnosed with in 1963. Hawking says that within this century, we’ll be able to edit intelligence, memory, and length of life. And that’s when things could get really complicated. <br />

Hawking calls the people who will do this **“superhumans,”** and they’re likely to be the world’s wealthy elites. Regular old humans won’t be able to compete, and will probably **“die out, or become unimportant.”** At the same time, superhumans will likely be **“colonizing other planets and stars.”** <br />

If that all sounds pretty depressing, it is. But even as Hawking serves up an apocalyptic prognosis for the planet and everyone on it, his brand of optimism comes through. He has faith that **“our ingenious race will have found a way to slip the surly bonds of Earth and will therefore survive the disaster.”** <br />

He even believes that, instead of being terrifying, these possibilities are thrilling and that it **“greatly increases the chances of inspiring the new Einstein. Wherever she might be.”** <br />

***Figuring out a way off of planet Earth, and maybe even the solar system, is an opportunity to do what the moon landings did: “elevate humanity, bring people and nations together, usher in new discoveries and new technologies.”*** <br />

## What are the threats that we possess in this modern world? <img src="https://github.com/Our-Destiny-R-D-Labs/.github/blob/main/profile/assets/PrivacyIco.gif" width="40px">

> "Data manipulation is the latest technique in the 'art of war in cyberspace." or "Humans should be worried about the threat posed by artificial intelligence."


## Do we deserve privacy?

> Marlon Brando, Actor said, "Privacy is not something that I’m merely entitled to, it’s an absolute prerequisite." Do you agree with that?
Personal Computing Pioneer and Investor Mitchell Kapor said, "Getting information from the Internet is like taking a drink from a hydrant." Has data on the internet became that

![App Screenshot](https://github.com/ODRDLabs/Project-JARVIS/blob/main/Jarvis_Mark-II_Screenshots/JARVIS_Loading_Screen.png)

This is how the intro video fits into JARVIS's GUI at the time of startup.


## Main Window (Home Screen)

![App Screenshot](https://github.com/ODRDLabs/Project-JARVIS/blob/main/Jarvis_Mark-II_Screenshots/Jarvis_Home_Screen.jpg)

The home screen of JARVIS contains the following Upgrades : 

- A borderless window.
- Custom close and minimize buttons.
- A language selector button.
