## Do we deserve privacy?




    Marlon Brando, Actor said, "Privacy is not something that Iâ€™m merely entitled to, itâ€™s an absolute prerequisite." Do you agree with that?
    Personal Computing Pioneer and Investor Mitchell Kapor said, "Getting information from the Internet is like taking a drink from a hydrant." Has data on the internet became that
    




#### The movie "Iron Man" inspired me alot to look for an AI based Personal Digital Assistant in real-world. My search for JARVIS ended up in a Project made by Michael C's Customizable JARVIS-Mark I. The program was so cool that it gave me goosebumps and made me feel like IRONMAN. The program had it's limitations and as well as i had customization idea's after watching the movie. This Repo is about the follow-up done by me to MARK I and additional features added by me to the default program back in 2013. This is my upgraded version of JARVIS.


## Features

- New UI (Borderless UI - Custom Made)
- New speaking animation and improved intro video quality.
- Hotword Detection
- Predefined Default Commands [Built-In]
- Shell Commands [Custom Addable]
- Social Commands [Custom Addable]
- Shut-Down System
- Restart System
- Logoff System
- Lock System
- Set - Alarm - Say "set the alarm", he will ask what time, then say the time. This feature is saved in the settings.
- Control Brightness
- Control Volume
- Play Music - command supports .mp3, .m4a, and .wav file formats.
- Play Video - command supports .mp4, .avi, and .mkv file formats.
- You no longer have to restart JARVIS to update commands. Just click Add and say Update Commands.
- JARVIS should check if the grammar's were loaded properly and let you know if there is a missing element in your commands.
- You can now choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit Temperatures.
- You can control windows explorer.
- Open New windows.
- Open browsers.
- Search in Google.
- You can say "Stop listening" to keep Jarvis from listening and say "Jarvis Come Back Online" to get him to start listening. Or you can Click on the background image to make him start listening.
- Saying "Refresh libraries" will reload all files within your music and video directories.
- You can now check your Gmail account for new emails. The new commands for this feature are: (Check for new emails, Read the email, Open the email, Next email, Previous email, and Clear email list). Jarvis can only read the Sender, Subject, and Summary information. To read the entire email you must say, "Open the email". Each of these new commands can interrupt Jarvis from speaking. Ex: If he is reading a long email you can say, "Next email" and he will immediately move on. This interruption feature will be implemented to all commands soon.
- You can now say "Set the volume to (number) percent" for music.

#### All the above Features are rule based and is not pure Artificial Intelligence.
