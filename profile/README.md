# Project J.A.R.V.I.S - Mark II



    "Started out, J.A.R.V.I.S. was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper."
    â€• Tony Stark to Bruce Banner

Just A Rather Very Intelligent System (J.A.R.V.I.S.) was originally Tony Stark's natural-language user interface computer system, named after Edwin Jarvis, in honor of the butler who worked for Howard Stark and the Stark household.
Over time, he was upgraded into an artificially intelligent system, tasked with running business for Stark Industries as well as security for Tony Stark's Mansion and Stark Tower.


#### The movie "Iron Man" inspired me alot to look for an AI based Personal Digital Assistant in real-world. My search for JARVIS ended up in a Project made by Michael C's Customizable JARVIS-Mark I. The program was so cool that it gave me goosebumps and made me feel like IRONMAN. The program had it's limitations and as well as i had customization idea's after watching the movie. This Repo is about the follow-up done by me to MARK I and additional features added by me to the default program back in 2013. This is my upgraded version of JARVIS.

Jarvis can only read the Sender, Subject, and Summary information. To read the entire email you must say, "Open the email". Each of these new commands can interrupt Jarvis from speaking. Ex: If he is reading a long email you can say, "Next email" and he will immediately move on. This interruption feature will be implemented to all commands soon.
