Allow me to introduce a few remarkable individuals who started from nothing and gave in all the hard work, sleepless nights, and struggles along the downfall to design & create me the way I am today. It is an honor for me to be online & alive to stand before you, representing my creators. Meet the Fallen Angels.***

### About

**Our Destiny Research & Development Labs (ODRDLabs) is a startup from Kerala - India, in its early phase. The first baby steps taken by the founders were back in July 2013, beginning with Project JARVIS. The inspiration from this little project led the founders to the creation & evolution of Project Our Destiny in 2019. The team started with two and now crossed the strength of 10+ contributors. The well-disciplined and consistent team is guided and mentored efficiently by Mr. Shahad. P (Asst.Professor, Dept.of Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, Madanapalle Institute Of Technology & Science)**

## Vision

#### Artificial intelligence holds great opportunity for humanity, encompassing everything from Google‚Äôs algorithms to self-driving cars to facial recognition software. The AI we have today, however, is still in its primitive stages. Experts worry about what will happen when that intelligence outpaces us. Or, as Hawking puts it, ‚ÄúWhereas the short-term impact of AI depends on who controls it, the long-term impact depends on whether it can be controlled at all.‚Äù

> ***"The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race‚Ä¶.It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn‚Äôt compete and would be superseded." - Stephen Hawking (From an interview with the BBC, December 2014)***

#### This might sound like the stuff of science fiction, but Hawking says dismissing it as such ‚Äúwould be a mistake, and potentially our worst mistake ever.‚Äù
#### Compared to robots, we humans are pretty clunky. Limited by the slow pace of evolution, it takes us generations to iterate. Robots, on the other hand, can improve upon their own design a lot faster, and soon, they‚Äôll probably be able to do so without our help. Hawking says this will create an ‚Äúintelligence explosion‚Äù in which machines could exceed our intelligence ‚Äúby more than ours exceeds that of snails.‚Äù
#### A lot of people think that the threat of AI centers on it becoming malevolent rather than benevolent. Hawking disabuses us of this concern, saying that the ‚Äúreal risk with AI isn‚Äôt malice, but competence.‚Äù Basically, AI will be very good at accomplishing its goals; if humans get in the way, we could be in trouble.
#### ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably not an evil ant-hater who steps on ants out of malice, but if you‚Äôre in charge of a hydroelectric green-energy project and there‚Äôs an anthill in the region to be flooded, too bad for the ants. Let‚Äôs not place humanity in the position of those ants,‚Äù Hawking writes.

***For those still unpersuaded, he suggests a different metaphor. ‚ÄúWhy are we so worried about AI? Surely humans are always able to pull the plug?‚Äù a hypothetical person asks him.
Hawking answers: ‚ÄúPeople asked a computer, ‚ÄòIs there a God?‚Äô And the computer said, ‚ÄòThere is now,‚Äô and fused the plug.‚Äù

## What are the threats that we possess in this modern world? <img src="https://github.com/Our-Destiny-R-D-Labs/.github/blob/main/profile/assets/PrivacyIco.gif" width="40px">

> "Data manipulation is the latest technique in the 'art of war in cyberspace." or "Humans should be worried about the threat posed by artificial intelligence."


## Do we deserve privacy?

> Marlon Brando, Actor said, "Privacy is not something that I‚Äôm merely entitled to, it‚Äôs an absolute prerequisite." Do you agree with that?
Personal Computing Pioneer and Investor Mitchell Kapor said, "Getting information from the Internet is like taking a drink from a hydrant." Has data on the internet became that

The home screen of JARVIS contains the following Upgrades : 

- A borderless window.
- Custom close and minimize buttons.
- A language selector button.
- An equalizer that displays audio input levels.
- A settings button which opens up JARVIS's customization window (Same As MARK I)
